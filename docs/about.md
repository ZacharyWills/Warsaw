This is a small blog page I made to recount my time in Warsaw in March 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

I'm a graduate of the [University of Missouri Columbia](https://missouri.edu) in [International Studies](https://internationalstudies.missouri.edu/), with a minor in Russian and a Multicultural Certificate. 

For more about my day-to-day work at [NOAA's National Water Center](http://github.com/NOAA-OWP) check [me](https://github.com/ZacharyWills) out on GitHub.
