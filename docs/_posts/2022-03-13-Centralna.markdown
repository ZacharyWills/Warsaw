There's a decent chance that you've seen this week that [the President of the United States went to Warsaw](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/20/statement-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-on-president-bidens-travel-to-poland/) and spoke with Ukrainians who had fled the Russian invasion that started on Feb. 24th of this year. 

I'm sure there were a lot of people to choose from, in my brief time in Warsaw the majority of the 'on the ground' work that I did was in Warsaw Central Station, which is a train station in the central part of Warsaw about five tram stops from where I was staying.

The station on the inside consists of three levels. The main level is number 1 (or zero if you're Polish or English) which is the ground floor. It has the ticket booths, some shops and three central pillars that host the volunteer operations, the transport and housing desks that find travel and lodging situations for Ukrainians free of charge, and finally the desk that includes free telephone sim-cards and medical tent. Most days I started at the volunteer desk, gave them my info, got my assignment and received my items until I looked like this:

The buttons are a helpful reminder to anyone looking about the languages in which you can help, and often times I included a Ukrainian flag pin at the request of our Ukrainian volunteers to make sure that people knew about my support, even if my understanding of the language itself is below par (for the record I speak English and Russian pretty well, I can understand Polish to a degree and Ukrainian just enough to know it's a language I cannot speak).

Once I had my items I would take a few minutes to walk around and help with small items like showing people where the bathrooms are, informing people about the tickets (they had signs for these in Ukrainian but they were small and most people wanted human assistance). As an example of this confusion, a train ticket to Berlin Hauptbahnhof station says "Rzepin" which is a lovely western-Polish town and where the train crosses the border with Germany. This led to many confusing exchanges where I try and explain that that's the right ticket, it just says the crossing name and not the destination name. Ultimately I ended up just telling most people that it was the station name, but goes to Berlin.

These big boards usually showed the train times including delays. The main two trains out of Poland from Centralna go to Berlin and Vienna via the western station (Zachodina) and the eastern station (Wschodina), as seen in this diagram which is outside the station:

The foreign volunteers are some of the best people I've ever met. No one was getting paid, and for the most part they were just working to get folks a better situation, and most importantly perhaps they are there everyday. I saw a lot of chruches come and go with vague fliers (in English of course to the amusement of our Polish hosts) about human trafficking but I never saw a church serve a single meal, house a single Ukrainian, or even drive anyone to a location where they could get help. I did however meet a lot of individuals, like Scott (not his real name) from New York show up despite not knowing the language, and buy hotel rooms and items from the adjacent mall like suitcases and coats for children and give them out for free for the duration of his business trip to Warsaw. 

I met more than 10 Ukrainians at the station who had found a place to stay, and turned around to help their fellow citizens by volunteering at the station. 
- Olena (name changed for anonymity) who had had COVID in Kiev, was taken by her friend to Lviv while she had a 39C temperature, and managed to get on the second train to Poland to leave after the invasion started. 
- Tatiana (name also changed) had been a music teacher and was one of the most decent people I've ever met. She helped every child and mother that came to her from start to finish. Often times we have to hand people off to a desk or go and help someone with a more immediate need, but she stuck with people until they were 100% in a better situation. 

I dont have any pictures here of these people, but they're still there. Everyday helping their fellow Ukrainians.
