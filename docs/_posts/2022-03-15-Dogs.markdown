Dobre Pies in Polish translates to "good dog". It's one of the first things I learned in Polish after seeing this ad:

Many of the dogs around Warsaw I stopped to take pictures of, and this is a selection:

Then there was this young girl, a Ukrainian, who was caring for her dog. I took great care to focus on the dog for these pictures because she was pretty embarassed to need help. She eventually got on a train to Lublin and was successfully reunited with her family there. 

This was at the bottom of the stairs going towards the concourse, above the rail platforms.

The dog had caught it's nail on the metal grate that protects the concourse from water, ripping off a nail from it's paw.

Here's where I say that the Polish Firefighters and Stazshchicki (civil service) folks are some of the most caring people I've ever met. They were there everyday when I got there and there when I left, even on the days when I was there 12+ hours. 

In this case they found a Polish veterinarian and cared for the dog which was very much in pain.

They got her a blanket as it was really cold (I wore a wool jacket everyday) and even bought her a hot drink once it was clear that she needed to wait a while for her train. The dog also wouldn't drink out of a shiny metal bowl so they found a nice ceramic mug. 

As I cleaned the dog's blood off the floor, I was reminded that when upending your life, often the comforting friends that we keep need to come along and have their own needs as well.

For every uniformed person helping there are countless treat bakers, bird specialists, and gecko terrarium builders that I saw as well.
