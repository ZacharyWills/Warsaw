:flight_departure:

On March 11th, I drove to ATL's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and left my Volvo in the lot and flew to JFK airport in NY. 

Arriving over the Atlantic I would recommend looking out of the aircraft to the West and to see Manhattan rise out of the landscape.

During my 11 hour layover I got an ice cream and enjoyed the hefty helping of nostalgia that New York as chosen for an age no one I met there had actually experienced first hand.

At least there are always more forms to do. Feels nice to have someone who knows where I am though.

Before I left I enjoyed watching the flipboard show a few flight changes, a mechanical struggle to achieve showing glyphs that our screens now dwarf in information conveyed for significantly lower cost and yet something with a universally appreciable aesthetic.

Following the rather quick 7.5 hour flight to Warsaw, and a cab ride from the airport to the National Stadium, I arrived at this vegetable stand...er the apartment (which is behind it through the grey door on the right).

The apartment was nice, clean and efficient. It had a gas stove, a shower and bed and radiators for heat.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
