On March 11th, I drove to ATL's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and left my Volvo in the lot and flew to JFK airport in NY. 

Arriving over the Atlantic I would recommend looking out of the aircraft to the West and to see Manhattan rise out of the landscape.

During my 11 hour layover I got an ice cream and enjoyed the hefty helping of nostalgia that New York as chosen for an age no one I met there had actually experienced first hand.

At least there are always more forms to do. Feels nice to have someone who knows where I am though.

Before I left I enjoyed watching the flipboard show a few flight changes, a mechanical struggle to achieve showing glyphs that our screens now dwarf in information conveyed for significantly lower cost and yet something with a universally appreciable noise and anticipation to it.

Following the rather quick 7.5 hour flight to Warsaw, and a cab ride from the airport to the National Stadium, I arrived at this vegetable stand...er the apartment (which is behind it through the grey door on the right).

The apartment was nice, clean and efficient. It had a gas stove, a shower and bed and radiators for heat.
