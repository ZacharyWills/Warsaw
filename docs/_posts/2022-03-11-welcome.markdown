On March 11th, I drove to ATL's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and left my Volvo in the lot and flew :flight_departure: to JFK airport in NY. 

Arriving over the Atlantic :ocean: I would recommend looking out of the aircraft to the West and to see Manhattan rise out of the landscape.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
